# Fraud Detection Model for Financial Transactions

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions for a financial company. The goal is to proactively identify fraudulent activities using data analysis and predictive modeling, followed by actionable insights to mitigate risks.

## Project Structure
- **Notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model development, and evaluation.
- **Data/**: Stores the dataset (not included in the repository due to size; download instructions provided below).
- **README.md**: Project description and instructions.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Provide the link to the dataset as mentioned in the task details.]
- **Size**: 6,362,620 rows Ã— 10 columns.
- **Data Dictionary**: [Link to the data dictionary.]

## Steps to Reproduce
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and multi-collinearity.
   - Perform feature engineering if necessary.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze distributions, correlations, and patterns in the data.
   - Visualize key metrics to understand fraud trends.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Split data into training and validation sets.
   - Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
   - Optimize hyperparameters using cross-validation.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assess performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
   - Interpret feature importance to identify key predictors of fraud.

5. **Actionable Insights**:
   - Propose prevention strategies based on model findings.
   - Suggest methods to monitor the effectiveness of implemented actions.

## Key Questions Addressed
1. How was data cleaning performed?
2. What model was chosen for fraud detection, and why?
3. How were variables selected for the model?
4. What tools were used to demonstrate model performance?
5. What are the key factors predicting fraudulent transactions?
6. Do these factors logically explain fraud? Why or why not?
7. What preventive measures should the company adopt?
8. How can the effectiveness of these measures be evaluated?
