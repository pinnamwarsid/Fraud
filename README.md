# Smart Traffic Surveillance: Helmet Detection and License Plate Recognition

## Overview
This project leverages **Computer Vision and Machine Learning** to enhance road safety by detecting helmet usage among motorcyclists and recognizing vehicle license plates in real-time. Using **Python**, **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**, and **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**, this solution automates traffic surveillance and assists law enforcement.

## Features
- **Helmet Detection**: Uses CNN to classify riders with and without helmets.
- **License Plate Recognition**: Implements OCR for extracting characters from license plates.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Integrates video feed processing to detect violations dynamically.
- **Automated Alerts**: Sends notifications when non-compliant riders are detected.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras** (for CNN-based helmet detection)
- **OpenCV** (for image and video processing)
- **Tesseract OCR** (for license plate recognition)
- **Flask / FastAPI** (optional API integration for reporting)
- **NumPy & Pandas** (for data preprocessing)
